                <li class="professional-history">I have worked for pay since September of 2020. I started my professional history during a very strange time, but doing so taught me a lot. I started working at Pet Supplies Plus, a local franchised pet store, when I was 17. During this time, my key responsibilities were stocking, cleaning, customer service, and animal care. In this position, I learned how to better manage my time, how to speak and act in a professional manner, and most importantly, what it is like to be in a working enviornment. My next position was at a Wal-mart supercenter, where my key responsibilities were stocking, providing any customers service, and unloading trucks throughout the workday. During my time at Wal-mart I worked hard but learned a lot. I learned how to effectively communicate to my co-workers in a concise manner, work under heavy time constraints, and how to adapt to many new, changing systems very quickly. After Wal-mart, I took part in a seasonal position with Mosquito Hunters of Owasso. This was a pest control position where my key responsibilities were; keeping track of invoices and schedules of each of our clients each day, treating our clients properties with pesticides, and maintaining an exact inventory of our products via a provided software. This job taught me a lot about the pest control industry, but the largest thing it taught me was responsibility. Each day, it was up to me keep track of clients, change appointments if needed, and most importantly, be on time to each house. Finally, my current position is with the company Home Instead. Within this company, I am a home health aide. My every day responsibilities are catered to each client, so pinning specifics would be difficult. But, my responsibility with each client is to make them a safe and comfortable enviornment within their home. This job has made me more effective at communicating to a broader audience of people. I can say that I am much more understanding and patient after being in this role! For where I would want to work, it is in technology. It is something I hold dear and hope to make it a part of my career!</li>
