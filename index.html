                <li class="about-me"> Hello! My name is Garrett Skilton, I am a student of Information Systems and a lover of technology. In my free time, I enjoy developing webpages and learing new programming languages. I am also an avid music-listener and a huge fan of The Deftones! At a young age I had started programming in C++ off and on, but not enough to hold a stable skillset in the language. Right now, I am sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and would like to start learning Python and C++ when I can! I love to travel and would enjoy visiting Europe, Asia, and Africa. As of now, I have only ever been within the United States. With this love of the world comes a love of people. I think the way technology and business interacts with different people and cultures is fascinating. As far as my personal accomplishmenmts, I would say most, as of now, are based in finance and education. When I was 17, I had saved up $13,000 from my first part-time job. I bought my first car for $1,200 and put money into my first stock, around $300. This is something I am  proud of, as it proved to myself that I can do these things if I put my mind to them. More recently, I opened my first credit card and started building my credit. With this, I have been looking more into real-estate and can see myself purchasing a property! As for educational accomplishmenmts, I was valedictorian of my graduating class. I have also managed, with hard work and dedication, to maintain a consistent 4.0 throughout my college career.</li>
